 hi 
this is the general meeting 
 well why i'm here 
to learn 
but i've been through bad strategie which lend me to this result 
which is I AM LATE SOS 
however i discovered a lot of tools is'nt 
and i don't care about the dead line 
what i care about is my understanding 
so go ahead code with a video then back to my code and i'll practice with it this is the strategy 
delever the code and practice at the same time 
technically i have more than 12 hours which is insane if i spend it all on this project 
so e brave and learn 10:10 pause every block or low level of energy
